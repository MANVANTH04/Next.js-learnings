App directory is a server component. 
and also all the pages are also in the server component


if we want to use the files in the client component then we have to 
mention "use client" at the top of the file. so that it will become the 
client component. 

and also the main benifit of the server component is that the data will not 
be transffered to the client's browser. if we keep the client component then 
the data would not be transffered. 
so we can keep the large dependencies at the server component so that the app would perform 
much faster. 

data fetching is also available in the server compenent, and to use that data we will 
use the server actions like  put  , post, delete.

if we want to use the fetch at the server compoenet. we have to create a funciton 
to store all the fetcing code. and in that function we have to use the "use server"
so that. that function uses the server compoenet to fetch the data. 



Suspense and streaming:- 

this is basically loading file. 

you can design the loading.tsx file so that when ever there is a loading happens
then. it will show the loading.tsx animation.

but the Suspense is something we will use when we want to show the animation only 
to the component. and not the entire page. then we will use the Suspense

cathcing, static and dynamic rendering.

every time we referesh we will get the same data based on the data 
that has been stored in the browser. but if we want to change that. then we have to
use the dynamic rendering. 

export const dynamic = "force-dynamic"

so that it will become dynamic and updates the data. 


Middleware

middlewares are basically helps in the authentication part of the website. 
where we can check weather the user is login or not. and also it is basically the process in 
between the sends and the receiver. acts as a middle man. and check the authentication.
